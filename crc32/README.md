This folder contains precomputed CRC32 values (calculate with the reverse polynomial) for some Windows 32 bits DLLs.  
  
For quick lookups you can either grep this directory or use the executable "crc32" which takes the string as argument.  
  
The source of this file, crc32.asm, can be compiled using "compile.sh".  
  
Lastly, you can use "crc32_from_file.sh" to compute the CRC
